        <h3>How to set up router?</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <b>Decide where to place the router</b> <br />
            --The best place for a wireless business router is in an open area
            of the workplace, as you'll benefit from even coverage. However,
            sometimes it's not easy to find a space out in the open because you
            must connect the router to a broadband gateway from your ISP
            (Internet service provider), which is usually attached to a cable
            near an outside wall.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Connect to the Internet</b> <br />
            --Attach the router to a cable - or choose a mesh router. To solve
            the "long-distance" problem when connecting a router, you can use a
            CAT5e or CAT6 cable to connect the router to the ISP gateway's
            Ethernet port. Another option is to run Ethernet cables through the
            walls of your office to the chosen central location for the router.
            <br />--Yet another option is to install a mesh network with a
            router. A mesh network allows you to place multiple Wi-Fi
            transmitters across your home or office, all on one network. Unlike
            extenders, which can be used with any wireless router, mesh networks
            require a router with this capability built-in. No matter which
            option you choose, you'll use a basic Ethernet cable, plugged into
            the router's wide-area network (WAN) or Internet port. The Internet
            port is typically set apart from other ports by a different color.
            <br />--Check the router's LED lights Your router's LED lights tell
            you if you've successfully made an active Internet connection. If
            you don't see lights confirming such a connection, make sure you've
            plugged the cable into the correct port. <br />--Test the connection
            with a device Confirm that your router has a working connection by
            plugging a laptop computer into one of the device ports on the back
            of the router. If all goes well, you should be able to begin a wired
            connection, just as you did when confirming an active Internet
            connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Configure the wireless router gateway</b><br />
            --In some cases, ISPs offer customers gateways with built-in
            routers. In most cases, these combined devices are not built for
            business environments, nor do they have extra ports, security, and
            other options that allow you to add services and expand networks as
            the business grow. <br />--If you have a gateway with an integrated
            router, you'll have to configure the gateway to disable the router
            and pass the WAN IP address—the unique Internet protocol address
            that the Internet provider assigns to your account—and all network
            traﬃc through to your new router. <br />--If you don't take this
            step, you may run into conflicts that prevent devices from working
            properly. You may need to contact your ISP for help with this step.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Connect gateway to router</b> <br />
            --First, turn off the gateway. If there is already an Ethernet cable
            plugged into the gateway's local-area network (LAN) port, unplug the
            cable and plug it into your router's WAN port. Turn the gateway back
            on and wait a few minutes for it to boot up. Plug in the router's
            power supply and turn it on, again waiting a few minutes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Use app or web dashboard</b> <br />
            --The easiest way to continue with router setup is to use a mobile
            app if the router maker provided one. If there is no app, or you'd
            rather use the router's web-based dashboard, connect the router to a
            computer via an Ethernet cable. <br />--You might find the router's
            IP address printed on the back of device itself; if not, type
            192.168.1.1, a common router address, into the browser search bar.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Create a username and password</b> <br />
            --To configure the router, you'll need to log in, using its default
            admin name and password. You can usually find this information
            printed on the router itself, or in an accompanying user manual.
            <br />--Next, enter the required credentials. Once you're in, you
            should immediately create a new username and password. The defaults
            are usually something like "admin" and "password1234," which are
            obviously not secure—so make sure to change them at the first
            opportunity.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Update the router's firmware</b> <br />
            --Your router may need an update of the "firmware," or software that
            operates it. Update it as soon as possible, since the new firmware
            might fix bugs or offer new security protections. <br />--Some
            routers may download new firmware automatically, but many do not.
            You may need to check for updates through the app or the browser
            interface.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Set a Wi-Fi password</b> <br />
            --Just as most routers come with preassigned admin usernames and
            passwords, most also come with preset Wi-Fi usernames and passwords.
            You'll likely be prompted to change the Wi-Fi username and password,
            but even if you don't see such a prompt, plan to do so quickly.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Use auto-configuration tools where possible</b> <br />
            --If your router is equipped with auto-install features, rely on
            them to help complete setup. For example, you should be able to use
            auto-configuration to manage IP addresses with the Dynamic Host
            Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which automatically assigns IP
            addresses to devices. You can always change these addresses later.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Set up security</b> <br />
            --Many router manufactures provide security functionality to
            safeguard network and user privacy. You can login into the web
            dashboard and enabling added security features such as firewall, web
            filtering, and access controls to protect yourself from malicious
            traffic. You can also set up virtual private networks (VPNs) for
            privacy.

        <h3>How to set up switch?</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <b>Inspect your hardware </b> <br />
            --Check the model number of your shiny new switch. Or, if you are
            using a spare, check the device hardware and its connected cables
            for any damages. If everything checks out, power on the switch and
            verify that all the indicator lights are in working order. Next, use
            a rollover cable to console into the switch from your computer. To
            do this, you will need to download and install Putty (or a similar,
            fun-named software tool). Run Putty and select the 9600 speed serial
            connection.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Set up management IP </b> <br />
            --Unlike with that punny name you gave your home Wi-Fi network, when
            setting up the hostname for your switch you should probably stick to
            a more professional and standard naming convention. --Follow any
            preset naming assignment your company is using and then assign an IP
            address on the management VLAN. Next, make sure your switch has a
            set hostname and domain name.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Check VTP revision number </b> <br />
            --Hit the show vtp status command to reveal your Virtual Trunking
            Protocol (VTP) revision numbers. The VTP revision numbers determine
            which updates are to be used in a VTP domain. When you set a VTP
            domain name, the revision number is set to zero—after which each
            change to the VLAN database increases the revision number by one.
            Your switch will only process data from a neighboring switch coming
            from the same domain and if the revision number of the neighboring
            switch is higher than its own. This means that the switches will
            update their VLAN configuration based on the VTP information being
            sent by the switch with the highest revision number. So, before you
            add your switch to the network, you're going to want to set its
            revision number to zero. To easily reset the domain back to zero,
            change the config mode to transparent.
          </li>

            <b>Configure access ports </b> <br />
            --You might already have a template ready for access port
            configuration.

          <li>
            <b>Configure trunk ports </b> <br />
            --Enter the command sh int g0/1 capabilities and check the trunking
            protocol supported. --If ISL is supported, you have to issue the
            switchport trunk encapsulation dot1q on the trunk port
            configuration. If not, simply type switchport mode trunk. It means
            there is no other encapsulation supported so there is no need for an
            encapsulation command. It only supports 802.1Q.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Configure access ports </b> <br />
            --After already performing basic network switch configurations, it's
            time to generate RSA keys to be used during the SSH process, using
            the crypto commands shown here:
            <br />--Choose the size of the key modulus in the range of 360 to
            2048 for your General Purpose Keys. <br />--Choosing a key modulus
            greater than 512 may take a few minutes.

            <b>Set up VTY line configuration </b> <br />
            If you have not set the console line yet, you can easily input these

            <br />
            --If the local area network has other wireless devices, such as a
            router, place the access point in a location where its wireless
            signal would have minimum or no interference with other wireless
            devices within the LAN and where it would provide effective coverage
            with respect to the premises.
            <br />
            --If the purpose of the access point is to introduce wireless
            connectivity to a wired LAN, then place it in a location where the
            wireless signal would cover the greatest possible area with the
            least number of obstacles and the least amount of interference. If
            the device is powered by an AC/DC adapter, connect it to the access
            point and plug it into an electrical socket. If it is a PoE

            ><br />
            --Use an Ethernet cable to connect the access point to the router.
            The cable should be inserted into a LAN port on the router and into
            the main Ethernet port on the access point. This introduces the
            access point to the router’s created local area network.<br />
            --Use an Ethernet cable to connect the router to the computer. The
            cable should be inserted into a LAN port on the router and into the
            Ethernet port on the computer (typically there is only one). This
            puts the computer onto the network and allows direct access point
            and LAN management.<br />
            --If it is necessary to provide access to the Internet over the
            local area network, use an Ethernet cable to connect the router to
            the modem. Insert the cable into the main Ethernet port on the
            router and into the Ethernet port on the modem (typically there is

            Modern technologies have practically done away with the
            inconvenience of manual LAN setup, let alone Internet access setup.
            Once everything is properly connected and the devices have
            acknowledged each other's presence on the network, the user is ready
            to go.
            <br />
            If any basic setup is necessary either for the access point or for
            the network in general, the computer or the user manual should
            provide instructions on what specific steps to take.
            <br />
            Users can also change optional and advanced router settings by

            <b>Position the bridge</b>
            <br />
            Place the bridge within range of your wireless router's signal, and
            also within a cable's length of your wired devices.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Connect the bridge to your network</b>
            <br />
            If your router supports Wi-Fi Protected Setup, or WPS, setup is
            easy. Simply press the WPS buttons on your bridge and router to link
            them.
            <br />
            Look for the Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) logo on your router to make
            sure it supports this preferred security standard. Otherwise, you'll
            need to connect the bridge to your PC via Ethernet to configure your
            bridge. On your PC, open a web browser and enter http://dlinkap or
            http://192.168.0.50 to load the bridge's web configuration screen.
            <br />
            Next, on the bridge's web configuration screen, use the setup tool
            to connect the bridge to your wireless network. The tool lists the
            active SSIDs it can find. Pick your network's identifier, enter the
            password, and select Finish to reboot the bridge. Now you can
            disconnect the Ethernet cable between the bridge and your PC.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Plug in network devices </b>
            <br />
            Now that your bridge is connected to your network, connect your
            wired devices directly to the bridge via Ethernet.Your bridge will
            automatically connect any attached devices to your primary network
            over Wi-Fi.

        <h3>How to set up range extender?</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <b
              >Plug your Range Extender into a power outlet near your main
              Router/AP.</b
            >
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Push the WPS button on your main Router/AP first, then
              immediately push the WPS button on your Range Extender.</b
            >
            <br />
            Note1: After you have pushed WPS button of your Router/AP, you need
            to push WPS button of your Range Extender within 2 minutes. So we
            strongly suggest you should push WPS button of your RE product as
            soon as you have pushed WPS button of your router.
            <br />
            Note2: After pushing the WPS button of your Router/AP, your
            Router/AP's WPS LED should blink. If your Router/AP' WPS LED doesn't
            blink, it means you need to push the WPS button again until the WPS
            LED of your Router/AP blinks. The same reason is also suitable for
            RE product. After pushing the WPS button of your Range Extender, the
            WPS/RE light of your Range Extender should blink. If not, push
            again.
          </li>
          <li>
            The WPS process will last 2 minutes.
            <b
              >You can wait 2 minutes, and then check the wireless signal LED of
              your Range Extender.</b
            >
            If it's on (no matter what color it is or how many signal bars there
            are), then your Range Extender has been successfully connected to
            your main Router/AP.
          </li>
          <li>
            After 2 minutes, if the wireless signal LED of your Range Extender
            is still off, it means the WPS process fails. You may need to try
            one more or several more times of WPS operation, and repeat the
            steps above.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >At last, you can put your Range Extender in a proper place where
              you want to extend the wireless network's coverage, and enjoy the
              extended wireless network.</b
            >
            No need to repeat the process. Once it's done, it will connect
            automatically every time you plug it back in.

        <h3>How to set up hub?</h3>
        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            <b>Find the WAN or uplink port of the Ethernet hub.</b> Typically,
            it is located on the rear of the unit, and it is often separate from
            the LAN ports.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Connect an Ethernet cable</b> from the WAN port of the hub to
            either the Ethernet port of the internet modem or, if expanding a
            network, to an empty LAN port on the existing network's router,
            switch or hub.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Plug an Ethernet cable into one of the LAN ports on the Ethernet
              hub and connect the other end of cable to the computer or device
              that will be added to the network.</b
            >
            Repeat for any other devices that will need to be on the network.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Power up the Ethernet hub and the computers or other devices
              attached to it.</b
            >
            On the front of the hub will be a series of LEDs that correspond to
            each LAN and WAN port on the hub. Every port that has a cable
            plugged into it should have one or more of the LEDs lit that
            represent that port. If not, check the connections and swap out the
            Ethernet cable if necessary.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Configure the network settings on each connected computer.</b> If
            you are expanding a network and the network uses DHCP, or dynamic IP
            addressing, no configuration will be necessary. On networks using
            static IP addressing or on a new network setup using the Ethernet
            hub, each computer or device must be assigned a unique IP address.
            Local IP addresses must use the allowed “private” address pools that
            will not interfere with internet addresses. Acceptable addresses
            include 192.168.x.x, 172.16.x.x to 172.31.x.x, or 10.x.x.x. The “x”
            represents a number that is chosen by the user, from 0 to 254. All
            computers on the network should share the first three numbers in the
            address, with the final number representing the individual computer.
            In a network with three computers, for example, the first could be
            192.168.1.1, the second could be 192.168.1.2 and the third could be
            192.168.1.3, though the final number does not need to be sequential.

              >If you've purchased cable internet service, find a cable port in
              your house to connect the modem to.</b
            >
            If you've purchased DSL phone internet service, you'll need to plug
            the modem into your home's phone port. Find the port in the area of
            the house where you'd like to place the modem.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b
              >Plug one end of the coaxial (or coax) cable that came with your
              modem into the TV wall jack.</b
            >
            Plug the other end into the coax port on the back of your cable
            modem. If you're using a cable modem, you'll see a coax port where
            you can screw in the other end of the coax cable. If you're using a
            DSL modem, the port on the modem will have a label that says
            something like "Phone In" or "Phone."
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Next, plug the power connector end into the modem.</b> Insert the
            plug end into a wall power outlet.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b

              a startup program.</b
            >
            As it cycles through, you'll see the ports on the front of the modem
            blink and then go solid one at a time.
            <br />
            Typically these ports are: <br />

            You have several options for connecting to the internet through your
            router.
            <br />
            Built-In Wireless: Some ISPs offer modems with a built-in wireless
            router, so you don't need a secondary router. You can connect your
            devices to the modem's wireless network.
            <br />
            Direct LAN: Use a network cable to connect a wired router to the
            modem and connect your devices to the router using network cables.
            <br />
            Wireless: Use a network cable to connect a wireless router to the
            modem and connect your devices to the router via Wi-Fi.
            <br />
            If you choose a wired network or wireless approach, purchase a
            router and connect it to the modem's WAN port using a network cable.
